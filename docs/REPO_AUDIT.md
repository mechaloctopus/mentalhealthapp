# MoodSignal Repo Audit

This document tracks documentation accuracy, cleanup findings, and production-readiness risks discovered during repo review.

- `app/message/[id].tsx` — daily message modal.

### Tab routes

- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` — Today dashboard.

## Documentation Reconciliation Completed

- [x] README updated to reflect the actual side module.
- [x] Roadmap updated to mark existing side module capabilities as already built.
- [x] Architecture doc updated to include side-module architecture.
- [x] Content system doc updated to treat `src/side/content.ts` as the side quest/path source of truth.
- [x] Production checklist updated with real current progress.
- [x] Side module doc added.

## Cleanup Applied

### Removed stale storage key

Removed `KEYS.notificationsScheduled` from `src/lib/storage.ts`.

Reason: current notification scheduling uses `expo-notifications` directly and no inspected code references this key.

### Removed unused Today imports

Removed unused `BrandMark` and `Divider` imports from `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`.

Reason: the file did not render either symbol.

## Potential Redundancies / Watch Items

### Recommendation content vs side content

There are now two lightweight recommendation content sources:

- `src/data/wisdom.ts`
- `src/lib/purposeEngine.ts`

And one richer side content source:

- `src/side/content.ts`

This is acceptable as a transitional architecture, but production should avoid divergence.

Recommended next step: create `src/lib/sideQuestMatcher.ts` so recommendations can point to existing side quests instead of growing a parallel quest/purpose system.

### Stored check-in recommendation vs new recommendation engine

`src/lib/voice.ts` still embeds a basic recommendation inside each saved `CheckIn`.

`app/checkin.tsx` now computes a richer `nextStep` from `src/lib/recommendationEngine.ts` for the result screen.

This is acceptable for backward compatibility. Long term, decide whether saved check-ins should store:

- the basic recommendation snapshot,
- the richer recommendation snapshot,
- or only raw state, with recommendation computed at display time.

### Demo auth vs production auth

`src/lib/auth.ts` is still a dummy auth layer. `src/lib/authConfig.ts` and `src/lib/firebase.ts` show a real-auth path, but the production sign-in flow still needs implementation.

### AsyncStorage privacy

Core state and side state persist locally through AsyncStorage. This is good for prototype speed but not enough for sensitive production claims.

### SideProvider scope

`SideProvider` currently wraps only the `app/side/` stack. This keeps side state isolated, but it means the main Today tab cannot show live side-module stats unless:

1. Side state is lifted to root, or
2. a read-only side-state hook/loader is created for dashboard surfaces, or
3. Today links into the side module without live stats.

The current Today dashboard uses option 3.

## Recommended Next Cleanup / Refactor Pass

1. Add `src/lib/sideQuestMatcher.ts` to bridge recommendations to existing side quests.
2. Add tests for pure functions before larger refactors.
3. Decide whether `CheckIn.recommendation` should remain stored.
4. Add a root-accessible side progress summary if the Today dashboard should show live resonance.
5. Add CI for `npm run lint` / `tsc --noEmit`.
6. Run a local TypeScript check and fix any unused imports the compiler reports.

## Manual Verification Needed

Because this review was done through GitHub file access rather than a local clone, the following still need local validation:

- `npm install`
- `npm run lint`
- `npx expo start`
- iOS simulator or device test
- Android device test
- voice recording test
- notification scheduling/deep-link test
- side quest completion test
- reset/export test
